Ready to run. And I went to the park and ran 5k. My body was fighting me and telling: 'just stop, it's cold, it hurts, I can't do it'. But I chose to listen to my happy and positive side: 'it's only 5k, you don't have to run fast, just take your time and you'll be fine. Think about all the joy and feeling of accomplishment afterwards'. And I ran my 5k and I didn't stop. Hurra!\r\n\r\nLet me tell you, running is not my thing, not yet. I love going to the gym, cycling, hiking and other active ways of spending time. But running is tough for me. I don't enjoy it, yet. But last year I started to run. My boyfriend Lucas is addicted to running and I was always curious why he likes running so much. So last year I signed myself for Oslo marathon to run 10k. I needed some motivation to start running. So I set myself a goal to run 10k under 1 hour. It's not very big accomplishment for most of the people. But I have never ran 10k in my life! So for me it was a big deal. Long story short, after spending my summer running and preparing, I managed to run 10k in 48:44! I was super proud and happy.\r\n\r\nThis year I set myself another goal. To run half marathon. I am not sure if I can do it, since I never ran more than 10k, but we'll see what happens. I wanted to say it out load, so I won't have an excuse to quit. My preparations started today with 5k. I didn't run since last september, so I took it slow. And to tell you the truth,I don't think I could have ran more. It was tough. But it's better than nothing. I still have lots of time till Oslo marathon in september, right? I will keep you updated how it goes.\r\nOne thing what I really like after running is my Green Smoothie bowl to reboot and recharge myself. I just go crazy and put whatever I am in the mood for. So, here it is, my bowl of super power happiness!\r\n<strong><\/strong>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>10k Green Smoothie!<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"noBorder\">\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-7.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-109 alignleft\" alt=\"photo-7\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-7-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\nYou'll need:<\/p>\r\n1 banana\r\nHalf avocado\r\n1 cup almond milk\r\nHalf cup oats\r\n1Tbsp chia seeds\r\n2 dates\r\n1tsp of each: of spirulina, amla and wheatgrass<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"noBorder\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-11.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-108 alignright\" alt=\"photo 1\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-11-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Just blend everything.

    "post_content": "I'm a 28 year old Lithuanian living in beautiful Oslo, Norway. Although I have a degree in International Management and Marketing, I'm at my happiest in the kitchen. Currently I'm working in the organic cafe and helping to produce natural, unprocessed and clean foods. \u00a0I love to cook. I love to think about food. \u00a0And I love to eat.\r\n<blockquote><em>People who love to eat are always the best people. ~ Julia Child<\/em><\/blockquote>\r\nI like experimenting in the kitchen. The internet is filled with amazing, inspiring and motivating food blogs. I wish the day had more than 24 hours and I had more time to try out all the yummy recipes and give them my personal touch. Most of the time I avoid gluten, dairy and sugar and have been trying out raw recipes and 'super foods' in my diet. I like eating food that makes me feel good.\r\n<blockquote><em>We all eat &amp; it would be a sad waste of opportunity to eat badly. ~ Anna Thomas<\/em><\/blockquote>\r\nI decided to start my own blog for two reasons. Firstly, for myself, to help keep track of my recipes, ideas and inspirations. \u00a0Secondly, to motivate and inspire others to make healthier choices in their every day foods and to feel healthier and HAPPIER. Because I believe that the most important thing in life is to be happy! Happiness is a choice and I choose to be Incurably Happy!\r\n\r\nAsta.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/Asta.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-22\" alt=\"Asta\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/Asta-239x300.jpg\" width=\"239\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>",

    "post_content": "'Good morning sunshine!' I wish I'd say that, but it's been raining in Oslo for the last week and I woke up again with grey skies and yucky weather. I don't even remember when was the last time I saw the sun. But this post is not about complaining about the weather. I'm just drawing a picture in your mind. It's not only sunshines and blue skies in my life \u00a0:)\r\n\r\nI have a day off today, so I allowed myself to sleep for 10 hours! I had a super busy 6 work days in a row, so I think I deserve myself a treat and this time it was sleep. Feeling so fresh and rested now, like a new person. I love my kitchen job, but I need my rest days as well. So today it's going to be a ME day at home. Firstly blogging, then some catching up on nutrition (I'm taking a course on Coursera). Afterwards treating myself with a bath in the middle of the day, just because I can :)\r\n\r\nNow let's get back to what I really \u00a0wanted to share with you. It's about me falling in love with juicing. Yes, I love juicing. It's a good way to increase your daily veggie intake and it can taste absolutely delicious. Freshly squeezed veggie juice...Yum yum yum! Last summer we (referring to me and my boyfriend. I like to include him in my stories, because I'm incurably in-love with him and I like using WE) got ourselves a juicer. Nothing fancy, just a regular Phillips juicer, but it works fine. We made so many different juices, some of them better than others. Once I tried to juice leek, It was not a success. The only thing I don't like about juicing is the leftover pulp. I'm trying to be creative and use it for making veggies burgers or crackers, because I don't like throwing away food. Yes, I refer to leftover pulp as food. Recently I try to limit myself to juicing only a few times a week. Only because I don't want to eat leftover pulp foods every day. There are so many more better food options:)\r\n\r\nThe first juice we ever made was beetroot, carrot and apple. \u00a0It was super delicious. Maybe because we're crazy about beetroot or maybe because it was our first homemade juice, but since then beetroot is very high on our juicing list. So\u00a0let me introduce you to Beetrootini, winner juice at our home.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo.PNG.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-43 alignleft\" alt=\"photo.PNG\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo.PNG-300x264.jpeg\" width=\"300\" height=\"264\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Beetrootini <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> <\/strong><em>2 small beetroot,\u00a02 carrots,\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">2 apples half lemon or lime (both works well, whatever is available),\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">2cm of ginger root (or more if you like ginger).\u00a0<\/span><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Juice it all and serve in the martini glass for a special treat. Enjoy!<\/span><\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm working on perfecting beetroot juice pulp fish cakes recipe. Will try to share my perfection soon.\r\n\r\nHappy Friday! Let's juice something yummy this weekend :)\r\n\r\nAsta",

But then I decided just to start writing whatever I feel like sharing today. And today I feel like sharing my pancakes recipe. To tell you the truth,\u00a0I was never a big fan of pancakes. In my life I made them maybe just a few times and those times there not a success. I have to admit I'm pretty bad in making pancakes. Waffles I can do, but pancakes... I am never able to flip them right or to make a perfect shape. Maybe that's the reason I mostly never make them. I just don't like to make something I am not good at.\r\n\r\nYesterday I decided to give pancakes a try again, because it was international pancakes day! It \u00a0was difficult to decide what to make. I had a few conditions. They had to be gluten free, because lately I'm trying to avoid this stuff. And they had to be savory, because I don't like sweet dinners. After checking my cabinets for ingredients and doing some research online, I decided to try \u00a0to make chickpea flour pancakes. And it was a success! I was really surprised and proud of myself. First pancake of course was a little burned and I struggled to flip it over, but the rest were fine, more than fine actually. They were not perfect shape, but the taste... it was one of the best savory pancakes I ever tried. Yum yum yum!

But then I decided just to start writing whatever I feel like sharing today. And today I feel like sharing my pancakes recipe. To tell you the truth,\u00a0I was never a big fan of pancakes. In my life I made them maybe just a few times and those times there not a success. I have to admit I'm pretty bad in making pancakes. Waffles I can do, but pancakes... I am never able to flip them right or to make a perfect shape. Maybe that's the reason I mostly never make them. I just don't like to make something I am not good at. But yesterday I decided to give pancakes a try again, because it was international pancakes day! It \u00a0was difficult to decide what to make. I had a few conditions. They had to be gluten free, because lately I'm trying to avoid this stuff. And they had to be savory, because I don't like sweet dinners. After checking my cabinets for ingredients and doing some research online, I decided to try \u00a0to make chickpea flour pancakes. And it was a success! I was really surprised and proud of myself. First pancake of course was a little burned and I struggled to flip it over, but the rest were fine, more than fine actually. They were not perfect shape, but the taste... it was one of the best savory pancakes I ever tried. Yum yum yum! So, here it is, the recipe for the amazing chickpea flour pancakes!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-41\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-2-e1394035749695-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Dinner pancakes\r\n<\/span><em><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">\r\n<\/span><\/em><\/strong><em><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">300g chickpea flour\r\n<\/span>500ml water<\/em>\r\n<em>1\/2 red onion<\/em>\r\n<em>5 garlic cloves<\/em>\r\n<em>1 green chilli<\/em>\r\n<em>1tsp salt<\/em>\r\n<em>1tsp cayenne pepper<\/em>\r\n<em>1\/2tsp black pepper<\/em>\r\n<em>Olive oil, butter or ghee for frying \u00a0<\/em>\r\n\r\nDirections:\r\nStart with chopping onion, garlic and chilli in very tiny pieces.

Now it's time for the \"hardest\" part (at least for me) - \u00a0to make the pancakes. Heat the frying or crepes pan. I used my cast iron pan. Add some olive oil or butter and cook like regular pancakes\/crepes on both sides. I tried to make them as thin as possible, but... I'm not at that level yet. I made 8 pancakes, but I if you are advanced crepes maker, you can make more! Enjoy with your favourite toppings.

I don't even remember when was the last time I saw the sun. But this post is not about complaining about the weather. I'm just drawing a picture in your mind. It's not only sunshines and blue skies in my life \u00a0:)\r\n\r\nI have a day off today, so I allowed myself to sleep for 10 hours! I had a super busy 6 work days in a row, so I think I deserve myself a treat and this time it was sleep. Feeling so fresh and rested now, like a new person. I love my kitchen job, but I need my rest days as well. So today it's going to be a ME day at home. Firstly blogging, then some catching up on nutrition (I'm taking a course on Coursera). Afterwards treating myself with a bath in the middle of the day, just because I can :)\r\n\r\nNow let's get back to what I really \u00a0wanted to share with you. It's about me falling in love with juicing. Yes, I love juicing. It's a good way to increase your daily veggie intake and it can taste absolutely delicious. Last summer we (referring to me and my boyfriend. I like to include him in my stories, because I'm incurably in-love with him and I like using WE) got ourselves a juicer. Nothing fancy, just a regular Phillips juicer. The first juice we made was beetroot, carrot and apple. \u00a0It was super delicious. Maybe because we're crazy about beetroot or maybe because it was our first homemade juice, but since then beetroot is very high on our juicing list. \u00a0So let me introduce you Beetrootini, winner juice at our home.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo.PNG.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-43\" alt=\"photo.PNG\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo.PNG-300x264.jpeg\" width=\"300\" height=\"264\" \/><\/a>\r\n<h5><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Beetrootini<\/span>\r\n<\/strong><em>2 small beetroot\r\n2 carrots\r\n2 apples\r\nhalf lemon or lime (both works well, whatever is available)\r\n<\/em><em>2cm of ginger root\r\n<\/em>Juice it all and serve in the martini glass for a special treat. Don't throw away leftover juice pulp. You can use it to make some veggie burgers. I'm currently working on perfecting beetroot juice pulp fish cakes.

    "post_content": "'Good morning sunshine!' I wish I'd say that, but it's been raining in Oslo for the last week and I woke up again with grey skies and yucky weather. I don't even remember when was the last time I saw the sun. But this post is not about complaining about the weather. I'm just drawing a picture in your mind. It's not only sunshines and blue skies in my life \u00a0:)\r\n\r\nI have a day off today, so I allowed myself to sleep for 10 hours! I had a super busy 6 work days in a row, so I think I deserve myself a treat and this time it was sleep. Feeling so fresh and rested now, like a new person. I love my kitchen job, but I need my rest days as well. So today it's going to be a ME day at home. Firstly blogging, then some catching up on nutrition (I'm taking a course on Coursera). Afterwards treating myself with a bath in the middle of the day, just because I can :)\r\n\r\nNow let's get back to what I really \u00a0wanted to share with you. It's about me falling in love with juicing. Yes, I love juicing. It's a good way to increase your daily veggie intake and it can taste absolutely delicious. Freshly squeezed veggie juice...Yum yum yum! Last summer we (referring to me and my boyfriend. I like to include him in my stories, because I'm incurably in-love with him and I like using WE) got ourselves a juicer. Nothing fancy, just a regular Phillips juicer, but it works fine. We made so many different juices, some of them better than others. Once I tried to juice leek, It was not a success. The only thing I don't like about juicing is the leftover pulp. I'm trying to be creative and use it for making veggies burgers or crackers, because I don't like throwing away food. Yes, I refer to leftover pulp as food. Recently I try to limit myself to juicing only a few times a week. Only because I don't want to eat leftover pulp foods every day. There are so many more better food options:)\r\n\r\nThe first juice we ever made was beetroot, carrot and apple. \u00a0It was super delicious. Maybe because we're crazy about beetroot or maybe because it was our first homemade juice, but since then beetroot is very high on our juicing list. So\u00a0let me introduce you to Beetrootini, winner juice at our home.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo.PNG.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-43\" alt=\"photo.PNG\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo.PNG-300x264.jpeg\" width=\"300\" height=\"264\" \/><\/a>\r\n<pre><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Beetrootini<\/span>\r\n <\/strong>2 small beetroot\r\n 2 carrots\r\n 2 apples\r\n half lemon or lime (both works well, whatever is available)\r\n 2cm of ginger root (or more if you like ginger)\r\n Juice it all and serve in the martini glass for a special treat. Enjoy!<\/pre>\r\nCurrently I'm working on perfecting beetroot juice pulp fish cakes recipe. Will try to share my perfection soon.\r\n\r\nHappy Friday! Let's juice something yummy this weekend :)\r\n\r\nAsta",

    "post_content": "Here I am, sitting on the couch and trying to write my first ever post. I really wanted to write something special, something to wow everybody. But then I decided just to start writing whatever I feel like sharing today. And today I feel like sharing my pancakes recipe. To tell you the truth,\u00a0I was never a big fan of pancakes. In my life I made them maybe just a few times and those times there not a success. I have to admit I'm pretty bad in making pancakes. Waffles I can do, but pancakes... I am never able to flip them right or to make a perfect shape. Maybe that's the reason I mostly never make them. I just don't like to make something I am not good at.\r\n\r\nYesterday I decided to give pancakes a try again, because it was international pancakes day! It \u00a0was difficult to decide what to make. I had a few conditions. They had to be gluten free, because lately I'm trying to avoid this stuff. And they had to be savory, because I don't like sweet dinners. After checking my cabinets for ingredients and doing some research online, I decided to try \u00a0to make chickpea flour pancakes. And it was a success! I was really surprised and proud of myself. First pancake of course was a little burned and I struggled to flip it over, but the rest were fine, more than fine actually. They were not perfect shape, but the taste... it was one of the best savory pancakes I ever tried. Yum yum yum! So, here it is, the recipe for the amazing chickpea flour pancakes!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-41\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-2-e1394035749695-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n<pre><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Dinner pancakes\r\n <\/span><em><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">\r\n <\/span><\/em><\/strong><em><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">300g chickpea flour\r\n <\/span>500ml water<\/em>\r\n <em>1\/2 red onion<\/em>\r\n <em>5 garlic cloves<\/em>\r\n <em>1 green chilli<\/em>\r\n <em>1tsp salt<\/em>\r\n <em>1tsp cayenne pepper<\/em>\r\n <em>1\/2tsp black pepper<\/em>\r\n <em>Olive oil, butter or ghee for frying \u00a0\r\n\r\n<\/em>Directions:\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Start with chopping onion, garlic and chilli in very tiny pieces.\r\nThen sift the flour and slowly mix it with water. \r\nIt'll be a liquid batter, but thats ok.\r\nThen add chopped ingredients, spices and mix it well. Voila, the batter is done!\r\nNow it's time for the \"hardest\" part (at least for me) - to make the pancakes.\r\nHeat the frying or crepes pan. I used my cast iron pan. \r\nAdd some olive oil or butter and cook like regular pancakes on both sides. \r\nI tried to make them as thin as possible, but... I'm not at that level yet. \r\nI made 8 pancakes, but if you are advanced crepes maker, you can make more! \r\nEnjoy with your favourite toppings. \r\nMy choice was saut\u00e9ed spinach, fried mushrooms, feta and mustard. \r\nBon appetit!<\/span><\/pre>",

    "post_content": "I love breakfast. Either it's eggs or oatmeal, or superfood powered smoothie, I'll take it. For the last year I had developed this routine . Wake up at 6am. Glass of hot lemon water. Gym time. Shower. Breakfast around 8am - smoothie or oatmeal. And then work at 10am.\r\n\r\nBut two weeks ago I changed jobs and my routine got different. Some days I'm starting work at 7am. And I don't feel like waking up before 6am just to have time to make breakfast. I choose sleep. Therefore I looked in to some alternatives and gave a try to overnight oats. I tried them before a few times and liked them. But I never appreciated what a life saver they really are! It takes less than 5min to prepare them the night before. In the morning you just need to open the fridge, put the jar in your bag and you are good to go. You can eat them on the bus, metro or at your workplace. Brilliant! And they taste great, and you get all your nutritions to start a day. And we like nutritions, right?\r\n\r\n<strong> So here it is, my Life Saver Breakfast!<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/20140307-133438.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" alt=\"20140307-133438.jpg\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/20140307-133438.jpg\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n1 banana\r\n2\/3 cups of oats\r\n1Tbsp chia seeds\r\n1Tbsp goji berries\r\n2Tbsp dried mulberries\r\n1 cup your choice of milk (I use oat milk)\r\n1 glass jar.

    "post_content": "'Good morning sunshine!' I wish I'd say that, but it's been raining in Oslo for the last week and I woke up again with grey skies and yucky weather. I don't even remember when was the last time I saw the sun. But this post is not about complaining about the weather. I'm just drawing a picture in your mind. It's not only sunshines and blue skies in my life \u00a0:)\r\n\r\nI have a day off today, so I allowed myself to sleep for 10 hours! I had a super busy 6 work days in a row, so I think I deserve myself a treat and this time it was sleep. Feeling so fresh and rested now, like a new person. I love my kitchen job, but I need my rest days as well. So today it's going to be a ME day at home. Firstly blogging, then some catching up on nutrition (I'm taking a course on Coursera). Afterwards treating myself with a bath in the middle of the day, just because I can :)\r\n\r\nNow let's get back to what I really \u00a0wanted to share with you. It's about me falling in love with juicing. Yes, I love juicing. It's a good way to increase your daily veggie intake and it can taste absolutely delicious. Freshly squeezed veggie juice...Yum yum yum! Last summer we (referring to me and my boyfriend. I like to include him in my stories, because I'm incurably in-love with him and I like using WE) got ourselves a juicer. Nothing fancy, just a regular Phillips juicer, but it works fine. We made so many different juices, some of them better than others. Once I tried to juice leek, It was not a success. The only thing I don't like about juicing is the leftover pulp. I'm trying to be creative and use it for making veggies burgers or crackers, because I don't like throwing away food. Yes, I refer to leftover pulp as food. Recently I try to limit myself to juicing only a few times a week. Only because I don't want to eat leftover pulp foods every day. There are so many more better food options:)\r\n\r\nThe first juice we ever made was beetroot, carrot and apple. \u00a0It was super delicious. Maybe because we're crazy about beetroot or maybe because it was our first homemade juice, but since then beetroot is very high on our juicing list. So\u00a0let me introduce you to Beetrootini, winner juice at our home.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo.PNG.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-43 alignleft\" alt=\"photo.PNG\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo.PNG-300x264.jpeg\" width=\"300\" height=\"264\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Beetrootini <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> <\/strong>2 small beetroot,\u00a02 carrots,\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">2 apples half lemon or lime (both works well, whatever is available),\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">2cm of ginger root (or more if you like ginger).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Juice it all and serve in the martini glass for a special treat. Enjoy!<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm working on perfecting beetroot juice pulp fish cakes recipe. Will try to share my perfection soon.\r\n\r\nHappy Friday! Let's juice something yummy this weekend :)\r\n\r\nAsta",

    "post_content": "Here I am, sitting on the couch and trying to write my first ever post. I really wanted to write something special, something to wow everybody. But then I decided just to start writing whatever I feel like sharing today. And today I feel like sharing my pancakes recipe. To tell you the truth,\u00a0I was never a big fan of pancakes. In my life I made them maybe just a few times and those times there not a success. I have to admit I'm pretty bad in making pancakes. Waffles I can do, but pancakes... I am never able to flip them right or to make a perfect shape. Maybe that's the reason I mostly never make them. I just don't like to make something I am not good at.\r\n\r\nYesterday I decided to give pancakes a try again, because it was international pancakes day! It \u00a0was difficult to decide what to make. I had a few conditions. They had to be gluten free, because lately I'm trying to avoid this stuff. And they had to be savory, because I don't like sweet dinners. After checking my cabinets for ingredients and doing some research online, I decided to try \u00a0to make chickpea flour pancakes. And it was a success! I was really surprised and proud of myself. First pancake of course was a little burned and I struggled to flip it over, but the rest were fine, more than fine actually. They were not perfect shape, but the taste... it was one of the best savory pancakes I ever tried. Yum yum yum!

    "post_content": "'Good morning sunshine!' I wish I'd say that, but it's been raining in Oslo for the last week and I woke up again with grey skies and yucky weather. I don't even remember when was the last time I saw the sun. But this post is not about complaining about the weather. I'm just drawing a picture in your mind. It's not only sunshines and blue skies in my life \u00a0:)\r\n\r\nI have a day off today, so I allowed myself to sleep for 10 hours! I had a super busy 6 work days in a row, so I think I deserve myself a treat and this time it was sleep. Feeling so fresh and rested now, like a new person. I love my kitchen job, but I need my rest days as well. So today it's going to be a ME day at home. Firstly blogging, then some catching up on nutrition (I'm taking a course on Coursera). Afterwards treating myself with a bath in the middle of the day, just because I can :)\r\n\r\nNow let's get back to what I really \u00a0wanted to share with you. It's about me falling in love with juicing. Yes, I love juicing. It's a good way to increase your daily veggie intake and it can taste absolutely delicious. Freshly squeezed veggie juice...Yum yum yum! Last summer we (referring to me and my boyfriend. I like to include him in my stories, because I'm incurably in-love with him and I like using WE) got ourselves a juicer. Nothing fancy, just a regular Phillips juicer, but it works fine. We made so many different juices, some of them better than others. Once I tried to juice leek, It was not a success. The only thing I don't like about juicing is the leftover pulp. I'm trying to be creative and use it for making veggies burgers or crackers, because I don't like throwing away food. Yes, I refer to leftover pulp as food. Recently I try to limit myself to juicing only a few times a week. Only because I don't want to eat leftover pulp foods every day. There are so many more better food options:)\r\n\r\nThe first juice we ever made was beetroot, carrot and apple. \u00a0It was super delicious. Maybe because we're crazy about beetroot or maybe because it was our first homemade juice, but since then beetroot is very high on our juicing list. So\u00a0let me introduce you to Beetrootini, winner juice at our home.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo.PNG.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-43 alignleft\" alt=\"photo.PNG\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo.PNG-300x264.jpeg\" width=\"300\" height=\"264\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Beetrootini <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> <\/strong><em>2 small beetroot,\u00a02 carrots,\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">2 apples half lemon or lime (both works well, whatever is available),\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">2cm of ginger root (or more if you like ginger).\u00a0<\/span><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Juice it all and serve in the martini glass for a special treat. Enjoy!<\/span><\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm working on perfecting beetroot juice pulp fish cakes recipe. Will try to share my perfection soon.\r\n\r\nHappy Friday! Let's juice something yummy this weekend :)\r\n\r\nAsta",

I had a super busy 6 work days in a row, so I think I deserve myself a treat and this time it was sleep. Feeling so fresh and rested now, like a new person. I love my kitchen job, but I need my rest days as well. So today it's going to be a ME day at home. Firstly blogging, then some catching up on nutrition (I'm taking a course on Coursera). Afterwards treating myself with a bath in the middle of the day, just because I can :)\r\n\r\nNow let's get back to what I really \u00a0wanted to share with you. It's about me falling in love with juicing. Yes, I love juicing. It's a good way to increase your daily veggie intake and it can taste absolutely delicious. Freshly squeezed veggie juice...Yum yum yum! Last summer we (referring to me and my boyfriend. I like to include him in my stories, because I'm incurably in-love with him and I like using WE) got ourselves a juicer. Nothing fancy, just a regular Phillips juicer, but it works fine. We made so many different juices, some of them better than others. Once I tried to juice leek, It was not a success. The only thing I don't like about juicing is the leftover pulp. I'm trying to be creative and use it for making veggies burgers or crackers, because I don't like throwing away food. Yes, I refer to leftover pulp as food. Recently I try to limit myself to juicing only a few times a week. Only because I don't want to eat leftover pulp foods every day. There are so many more better food options:)\r\n\r\nThe first juice we ever made was beetroot, carrot and apple. \u00a0It was super delicious. Maybe because we're crazy about beetroot or maybe because it was our first homemade juice, but since then beetroot is very high on our juicing list. So\u00a0let me introduce you to Beetrootini, winner juice at our home.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo.PNG.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-43 alignleft\" alt=\"photo.PNG\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo.PNG-300x264.jpeg\" width=\"300\" height=\"264\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Beetrootini <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> <\/strong><em>2 small beetroot,\u00a02 carrots,\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">2 apples half lemon or lime (both works well, whatever is available),\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">2cm of ginger root (or more if you like ginger).\u00a0<\/span><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Juice it all and serve in the martini glass for a special treat.

I'm grateful and fortunate that I have the most amazing person to share my life with. I have the best boyfriend ever, and who makes me feel happy every single day. Without his help and support, I would have never started this blog.\r\n\r\nAnother my inspiration is my good friend Claudia. She is the nicest and most sincere person ever. And she knows a bunch about holistic nutrition, healthy foods, balanced life, yoga, travelling and so much more. I can always count on her for a life advice. You can <a href=\"http:\/\/instagram.com\/claudiavantunen\">find her on Instagram<\/a> if you want to know more about holistic nutrition or you need some tips for balancing your life. She has an amazing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.backpackgek.nl\">travel blog<\/a> as well!\r\n\r\nI recently met a super nice foodie, blogger and chef Julie. She is not only writing a very popular food blog in Norway and has her own Chiku catering business, but she is also a really friendly and nice person. I am learning a lot from her. Check out her <a href=\"http:\/\/grayzine.no\/matbloggen\/\">blog<\/a>\u00a0for food inspirations!\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">I am lucky I have met another foodie, who tries to make a positive change in people's life and offer them healthier, ecological eats and pressed juices. \u00a0I think she should start her own food blog, but until then check out her Instagram profile: <a href=\"http:\/\/instagram.com\/puroslo\">Pur Oslo<\/a>! I admire and get inspired from her posts every day.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Some other sources of my inspiration come from the\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.greenkitchenstories.com\">Green Kitchen Stories<\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"> website. It's my favourite food blog! All their recipes are amazing and nicely presented. \u00a0I would love to have the couple behind that website over for dinner.<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe last person, I would like to mention is Elri. I've never met her in person, but from\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/instagram.com\/elriuhre\">following her on Instagram<\/a> and reading her<a href=\"http:\/\/wearelife.weebly.com\/the-food.html\"> blog,<\/a> I feel like I know her. She has a very similar positive attitude towards life and food and she seems like a very warm and sincere person.

Hope everybody had a lovely weekend. I was working on Saturday. \u00a0In the evening I had a date night at home with my boyfriend. But Sunday was a special day to me. It was our 3 years anniversary. Woohoo! Three years of love and happiness! Who said love lasts only three years? I believe ours will last forever. Yep, I'm still inlove and see the world threw pink glasses.\r\n\r\nWe went to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smalhans.no\">Smalhans<\/a> for anniversary dinner. Great food, surprising wine list and nice personnel. Definitely going back there again! We took plenty of pictures. The place deserves a separate blog post.\r\n\r\nI love having date nights with my love. Yummy food, a glass of red wine and a movie. Perfect! Last Saturday we had House of Cards marathon. I really like this tv show. Kevin Spacey is brilliant. I love his acting, especially his occasional remarks and glances straight to the camera. We never manage to watch only one episode, because the show gets you hooked and you want to know what happens next. If you haven't seen this show, give it a try! You can find it on Netflix.\r\n\r\nTacos were on the menu to go with the show. We usually make them once a month. I especially love homemade salsa and guacamole! But let me tell you, it takes time to make Mexican food if you want to do everything by yourself. Of course you can buy everything prepared and packaged: tortillas, taco shells, salsa, guacamole. But I believe that home cooked meal, made from scratch with no rush and lots of love will always taste better. Furthermore you can use whatever ingredients you want and avoid preservatives. In most of the cases it'll be much healthier. And we want to be healthy and happy, right?\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Recently I was experimenting with low carb and gluten free taco shells. Flax seed tacos are our favorite at the moment - rich in fiber and taste great with salsa, minced meat and guacamole. And you need just a few ingredients.\u00a0It's not very easy to make them, but they are so worth it your time and frustration. Let me share with you my tips for making taco shells from flax seeds.<\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Flaxseed Taco Shells<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-12.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-141 alignleft\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>You'll need:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1 cup flaxseeds\r\n1\/4 cup sunflower seeds\r\n1tsp cayenne pepper\r\n1\/4 red onion\r\n1 clove garlic\r\n1\/2 red pepper\r\nsalt and pepper to taste (about 1tsp each)\r\n\r\n<em>Directions:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1. Mix flaxseeds with sunflower seeds and soak them overnight in 1.5 cups of water. Flax seeds will soak most of the water. The mixture will look like a pudding.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-23-e1394978536941.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-138\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with g3 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-23-e1394978536941-300x300.jpg\" width=\"270\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n2. Put the mixture in the blender with the rest ingredients and blend everything to a dough. Set the dough in the fridge for half an hour\r\n\r\n3. Now it's the most difficult part - to roll the dough and make taco shells. It'll be very sticky. I tried to roll it between two different baking papers. It works ok. Recently I took different approach. I cut the baking paper in the size of taco shells I wish to have, put some of the dough, cover it with plastic and flatten it with my fingers. This technique works best for me.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-32.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-139 alignleft\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-32-e1394979086502-225x300.jpg\" width=\"203\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a>\r\n4. Preheat the oven to 160 degress. Set the flat shells on the baking tray and bake them in the oven for about 40min. They should become dry and not sticky anymore. Then it's time to make them look like real taco shells. It's pretty easy. Just fold them in half and bake for another 15min or so until they become totally dry. \u00a0Remove the paper and enjoy them with your favorite taco fillings. I always go for salsa, guacamole and minced meat. Yum!\r\n\r\n<em>Note:<\/em> the baking time will depend on taco shells size, thickness and your oven. Check once in a while to see if they became dry and non-sticky. After folding them it takes only 10-15min to complete drying them.\r\n\r\nI made 9 pretty big taco shells. I think you could make around 12 smaller ones.\r\n\r\nIt will be a sequel to this post with ridiculously spicy Allan's salsa recipe. In a few days!\r\n\r\nBon app\u00e9tit!\r\n\r\nAsta",

If you haven't seen it yet, I highly\u00a0<\/span>recommend<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">! \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nThis movie reminded me of another excellent movies \u00a0by Wes Anderson - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1748122\/?ref_=tt_rec_tt\">Moonrise Kingdom<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0432283\/\">Fantastic Mr. Fox<\/a>. They are\u00a0as well quirky, sweet, beautiful and funny. I want to watch them again!\r\n\r\nI think it's a good trio for a movie night with your friends. Charming, colorful movies which make you laugh and feel happy!\r\n\r\nIf you're planning a movie night, you'll need some food, right? I suggest having tacos, because I like Mexican food. \u00a0I already posted my flax seed tacos and salsa recipes. And here goes my holy guacamole recipe. Simple, easy and super delicious! If you don't have time to make tacos, you can always use salsa and guacamole as yummy dips for chips or veggies for your movie night!\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Holy Guacamoly<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-3-copy.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-206\" alt=\"photo 3 copy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-3-copy-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><em><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>You'll need:<\/em><\/p>\r\n4 ripe avocados\r\nHalf of red onion\r\n1 lime\r\nHandful of cherry tomatoes\r\nBunch of fresh coriander\r\n1 tsp of each: salt, cumin and cayenne pepper\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>\u00a0<\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>Directions:\u00a0<\/em>\r\n\r\n1. Finely chop onion, coriander and cherry tomatoes.\r\n2. Mash avocados with the spices, half of onions and tomatoes. Use hand masher or blender.\r\n3. And the rest of chopped onions and tomatoes, squeeze the lime juice and mix well. I always leave some onions and tomatoes non mashed. I like some crunchy bites in my guacamole.\r\n4. Adjust salt, pepper and lime.\r\nVoila!\u00a0Enjoy on the toast, with your tacos or as a dip.\r\n\r\nSorry, no picture of the guacamole this time. The quality was not so good. But trust me, the taste is great! Will add the picture later, the next time I make it again. It'll be soon. I love guacamole.\r\n\r\nHave a wonderful the rest of the week \u00a0my lovelies! Don't forget to be Happy!\r\n\r\nAsta",

    "post_content": "Today I was thinking about my life in Norway, about friends, family and what does it mean to live in a foreign country. I moved to Norway more than four years ago. My sister got a job offer in Oslo and I had an opportunity to come and finish my master studies at BI. It was easy to decide since my sister was going to move to the same city at the same time.\u00a0I really wanted to study abroad and the timing seemed perfect. I think it was meant to be. In the last four years many things happened in my life. I graduated, found my love, made new friends and finally figured out what I want to do in my life. I'm not sure how my life would have been if I stayed in Lithuania. But I am happy now and that is all what matters to me.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/meandzuzu.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-187\" alt=\"meandzuzu\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/meandzuzu-300x200.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>Living abroad is not easy. The beginning was tough. Suddenly I was in a new place where I didn't know anything, I didn't know culture, people, places, language. I had to invest my time and energy in learning, meeting new people and making new friends outside my comfort zone. It was really difficult to be far away from my very good friends, whom I knew since my childhood. I missed them a lot and still do.\r\n\r\nI was always glad to meet new people with different backgrounds and experiences. But I don't believe you can become friends over night. For me it takes time to open up and let people in to my heart. I believe in quality and not quantity of friends. Even if I miss my Lithuanian friends and think about them quite often, after four years in Norway I can say that I have met people here whom I call friends now and believe that our connection will last forever. I feel like I belong here. Home is where my heart is. And it is in Oslo now.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about living in international Oslo, is that you get to meet people from all over the world, you get to know their culture, traditions and food! It's not a surprise, I love food! And I like to get to know people over a home cooked meal and a good glass of wine.\r\nI would like to share some of the recipes I got from my friends. Because they are just too good to be kept in secret!\r\n<blockquote>Friends who eat together, stay together!<\/blockquote>\r\nLet's start with my friend Allan. He is a very nice guy from Texas, whom I was lucky to meet in Oslo. It was sad that he had to move back to the States, but I believe that I'll see him again. He shared with me his salsa recipe. I've been using it for the last half a year. Trust me, it's really good! Texicans know their tex-mex food. I haven't made any other salsa since. It's definitely a winner at our home. Though it is crazy spicy! If you are up for the challenge, here is the recipe:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Allan's salsa<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-1-copy.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-190 alignright\" alt=\"photo 1 copy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-1-copy-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><em>You'll need:<\/em>\r\n\r\n2 handfulls of cherry tomatoes (I used 16)\r\n5 fresh jalapenos\r\n1 fresh habanero\r\nJuice of 1 lime\r\n1 green pepper\r\n1 red onion\r\n3 cloves garlic\r\n1 can of cherry tomatoes (400g)\r\nHandfull of fresh coriander\r\n1 tsp of each: salt, pepper, cumin\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-2-copy-e1395582606553.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-191 alignleft\" alt=\"photo 2 copy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-2-copy-e1395582606553-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><em>Directions:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1. Chop green pepper and heavily char it in the frying pan. It should be black and blistered.\r\n2. Remove seeds from jalape\u00f1os \u00a0and habanero.\r\n3. Peel and chop red onion in a few pieces.\r\n4. Put all the ingredients in the blender and blend it until desired consistency. I like my salsa very well blended.\r\nVoila!\r\n\r\n<em>Note:<\/em> It is really spicy! If you are not used to spicy food, I would suggest to use only half of habanero and less jalape\u00f1os at the beginning. You can always add more later.\r\nSalsa can stay in the air tight container in the fridge for up to five days.",

Ready to run! And I went to the park and ran 5k. My body was fighting me and telling: 'just stop, it's cold, it hurts, I can't do it'. But I chose to listen to my happy and positive side: 'it's only 5k, you don't have to run fast, just take your time and you'll be fine. Think about all the joy and feeling of accomplishment afterwards'. And I ran my 5k and I didn't stop. Hurra!\r\nLet me tell you, running is not my thing, not yet. I love going to the gym, cycling, hiking and other active ways of spending time. But running is tough for me. I don't enjoy it, yet. But last year I started to run. My boyfriend Lucas is addictive runner and I was always curious why he likes running so much. So last year I signed myself for Oslo marathon to run 10k. I needed some motivation to start running, some goal. It was to run 10k under 1 hour. It's not very big accomplishment for most of the people. But I have never ran 10k in my life! So for me it was a big deal. Long story short, after summer spending running I managed to run 10k in 48:44! I was super proud for myself. It was a big accomplishemnt for me.\r\nSo this year I set myself another goal. To run half marathon. I wanted to say it out load, so I won't have an excuse to quit. And my preparations started today, with 5k. I didn't run since last september, so I took it slow. And to tell you the truth,I don't think I could have ran more. It was tough. But it's better than nothing. I still have lots of time till Oslo marathon in september, right? I will keep you all updated how it goes.\r\nOne thing what I really like after running is my Smoothie bowl to recover and get nutritions and energy to continue the day. I just go crazy and put whatever I am in the mood for. So, here it is, my bowl of super power happiness!\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Super breakfast bowl!<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-7.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-109 alignleft aligncenter\" alt=\"photo-7\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-7-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>You'll need:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">1 banana<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Half avocado<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">1 cup almond milk<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Half cup oats<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">1Tbsp chia seeds<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">2 dates<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">1tsp of spirulina, amla and wheatgrass<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Topping: goji, coconut and cacao nibs<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/p>",

But I chose to listen to my happy and positive side: 'it's only 5k, you don't have to run fast, just take your time and you'll be fine.

I needed some motivation to start running, some goal. It was to run 10k under 1 hour. It's not very big accomplishment for most of the people. But I have never ran 10k in my life! So for me it was a big deal. Long story short, after summer spending running I managed to run 10k in 48:44! I was super proud for myself. It was a big accomplishemnt for me.\r\nSo this year I set myself another goal. To run half marathon. I wanted to say it out load, so I won't have an excuse to quit. And my preparations started today, with 5k. I didn't run since last september, so I took it slow. And to tell you the truth,I don't think I could have ran more. It was tough.

But I chose to listen to my happy and positive side: 'it's only 5k, you don't have to run fast, just take your time and you'll be fine.

My boyfriend Lucas is addicted to running and I was always curious why he likes running so much. So last year I signed myself for Oslo marathon to run 10k. I needed some motivation to start running, some goal. It was to run 10k under 1 hour. It's not very big accomplishment for most of the people. But I have never ran 10k in my life! So for me it was a big deal. Long story short, after summer spending running I managed to run 10k in 48:44! I was super proud for myself. It was a big accomplishemnt for me.\r\nSo this year I set myself another goal. To run half marathon. I wanted to say it out load, so I won't have an excuse to quit. And my preparations started today, with 5k. I didn't run since last september, so I took it slow. And to tell you the truth,I don't think I could have ran more. It was tough.

Ready to run! And I went to the park and ran 5k. My body was fighting me and telling: 'just stop, it's cold, it hurts, I can't do it'. But I chose to listen to my happy and positive side: 'it's only 5k, you don't have to run fast, just take your time and you'll be fine. Think about all the joy and feeling of accomplishment afterwards'. And I ran my 5k and I didn't stop. Hurra!\r\n&nbsp;\r\nLet me tell you, running is not my thing, not yet. I love going to the gym, cycling, hiking and other active ways of spending time. But running is tough for me. I don't enjoy it, yet. But last year I started to run. My boyfriend Lucas is addicted to running and I was always curious why he likes running so much. So last year I signed myself for Oslo marathon to run 10k. I needed some motivation to start running, some goal. It was to run 10k under 1 hour. It's not very big accomplishment for most of the people. But I have never ran 10k in my life! So for me it was a big deal. Long story short, after summer spending running I managed to run 10k in 48:44! I was super proud for myself. It was a big accomplishemnt for me.\r\nSo this year I set myself another goal. To run half marathon. I wanted to say it out load, so I won't have an excuse to quit. And my preparations started today, with 5k. I didn't run since last september, so I took it slow. And to tell you the truth,I don't think I could have ran more. It was tough. But it's better than nothing. I still have lots of time till Oslo marathon in september, right? I will keep you all updated how it goes.\r\nOne thing what I really like after running is my Smoothie bowl to recover and get nutritions and energy to continue the day.

Ready to run! And I went to the park and ran 5k. My body was fighting me and telling: 'just stop, it's cold, it hurts, I can't do it'. But I chose to listen to my happy and positive side: 'it's only 5k, you don't have to run fast, just take your time and you'll be fine. Think about all the joy and feeling of accomplishment afterwards'. And I ran my 5k and I didn't stop. Hurra!\r\n\r\nLet me tell you, running is not my thing, not yet. I love going to the gym, cycling, hiking and other active ways of spending time. But running is tough for me. I don't enjoy it, yet. But last year I started to run. My boyfriend Lucas is addicted to running and I was always curious why he likes running so much. So last year I signed myself for Oslo marathon to run 10k. I needed some motivation to start running, some goal. It was to run 10k under 1 hour. It's not very big accomplishment for most of the people. But I have never ran 10k in my life! So for me it was a big deal. Long story short, after summer spending running I managed to run 10k in 48:44! I was super proud for myself. It was a big accomplishemnt for me.\r\n\r\nSo this year I set myself another goal. To run half marathon. I wanted to say it out load, so I won't have an excuse to quit. And my preparations started today, with 5k. I didn't run since last september, so I took it slow. And to tell you the truth,I don't think I could have ran more. It was tough. But it's better than nothing. I still have lots of time till Oslo marathon in september, right? I will keep you all updated how it goes.\r\nOne thing what I really like after running is my Smoothie bowl to recover and get nutritions and energy to continue the day.

Ready to run! And I went to the park and ran 5k. My body was fighting me and telling: 'just stop, it's cold, it hurts, I can't do it'. But I chose to listen to my happy and positive side: 'it's only 5k, you don't have to run fast, just take your time and you'll be fine. Think about all the joy and feeling of accomplishment afterwards'. And I ran my 5k and I didn't stop. Hurra!\r\n\r\nLet me tell you, running is not my thing, not yet. I love going to the gym, cycling, hiking and other active ways of spending time. But running is tough for me. I don't enjoy it, yet. But last year I started to run. My boyfriend Lucas is addicted to running and I was always curious why he likes running so much. So last year I signed myself for Oslo marathon to run 10k. I needed some motivation to start running, some goal. It was to run 10k under 1 hour. It's not very big accomplishment for most of the people. But I have never ran 10k in my life! So for me it was a big deal. Long story short, after summer spending running I managed to run 10k in 48:44! I was super proud for myself. It was a big accomplishemnt for me.\r\n\r\nSo this year I set myself another goal. To run half marathon. I wanted to say it out load, so I won't have an excuse to quit. And my preparations started today, with 5k. I didn't run since last september, so I took it slow. And to tell you the truth,I don't think I could have ran more. It was tough. But it's better than nothing. I still have lots of time till Oslo marathon in september, right? I will keep you all updated how it goes.\r\nOne thing what I really like after running is my Smoothie bowl to recover and get nutritions and energy to continue the day.

So for me it was a big deal. Long story short, after summer spending running I managed to run 10k in 48:44! I was super proud for myself. It was a big accomplishemnt for me.\r\n\r\nSo this year I set myself another goal. To run half marathon. I wanted to say it out load, so I won't have an excuse to quit. And my preparations started today, with 5k. I didn't run since last september, so I took it slow. And to tell you the truth,I don't think I could have ran more. It was tough. But it's better than nothing. I still have lots of time till Oslo marathon in september, right? I will keep you all updated how it goes.\r\nOne thing what I really like after running is my Smoothie bowl to recover and get nutritions and energy to continue the day. I just go crazy and put whatever I am in the mood for. So, here it is, my bowl of super power happiness!\r\n<strong><\/strong>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Super breakfast bowl!<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"noBorder\">\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-7.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-109 alignleft\" alt=\"photo-7\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-7-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\nYou'll need:<\/p>\r\n1 banana\r\nHalf avocado\r\n1 cup almond milk\r\nHalf cup oats\r\n1Tbsp chia seeds\r\n2 dates\r\n1tsp of spirulina, amla and wheatgrass<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"noBorder\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-11.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-108 alignright\" alt=\"photo 1\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-11-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Just blend everything.

Ready to run. And I went to the park and ran 5k. My body was fighting me and telling: 'just stop, it's cold, it hurts, I can't do it'. But I chose to listen to my happy and positive side: 'it's only 5k, you don't have to run fast, just take your time and you'll be fine. Think about all the joy and feeling of accomplishment afterwards'. And I ran my 5k and I didn't stop. Hurra!\r\n\r\nLet me tell you, running is not my thing, not yet. I love going to the gym, cycling, hiking and other active ways of spending time. But running is tough for me. I don't enjoy it, yet. But last year I started to run. My boyfriend Lucas is addicted to running and I was always curious why he likes running so much. So last year I signed myself for Oslo marathon to run 10k. I needed some motivation to start running.

Nowadays you can buy everything prepared: tortillas, taco shells, salsa, guacamole. But the home cooked meal, made from scratch with no rush and lots of love will always taste better.\u00a0It has to be prepared with time and love.\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Recently I was experimenting with low carb and gluten free taco shells. Flax seed taco shells are our favorite at the moment - rich in fiber and taste great with salsa, minced meat and guacamole. \u00a0 It's not very easy to make them, but they are so worth it your time and frustration. Let me share with you my tips for making taco shells from flax seeds.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-12.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-141 alignleft\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>You'll need:\r\n\r\n1 cup flaxseeds\r\n\r\n1\/4 cup sunflower seeds\r\n\r\n1tsp cayenne pepper\r\n\r\n1\/4 red onion\r\n\r\n1 clove garlic\r\n\r\n1\/2 red pepper\r\n\r\nsalt and pepper to taste (about 1tsp each)\r\n\r\nDirections:\r\n\r\n1. Mix flaxseeds with sunflower seeds and soak them overnight in 1.5 cups of water. Flax seeds will soak most of the water. The mixture will look like a pudding.\r\n\r\n2. Put the mixture in the blender with the rest ingredients and blend everything to a dough. Set the dough in the fridge for half an hour.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-23-e1394978536941.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-138\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with g3 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-23-e1394978536941-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>3. Now it's the most difficult part - to roll the dough and make taco shells. It'll be very sticky. I tried to roll it between two different baking papers. It works ok. Recently I took different approach. I cut the baking paper in the size of taco shells I wish to have, put some of the dough, cover it with plastic and flatten it with your fingers. This technique works best for me.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

Flax seed taco shells are our favorite at the moment - rich in fiber and taste great with salsa, minced meat and guacamole. \u00a0 It's not very easy to make them, but they are so worth it your time and frustration. Let me share with you my tips for making taco shells from flax seeds.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-12.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-141 alignleft\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>You'll need:\r\n\r\n1 cup flaxseeds\r\n\r\n1\/4 cup sunflower seeds\r\n\r\n1tsp cayenne pepper\r\n\r\n1\/4 red onion\r\n\r\n1 clove garlic\r\n\r\n1\/2 red pepper\r\n\r\nsalt and pepper to taste (about 1tsp each)\r\n\r\nDirections:\r\n\r\n1. Mix flaxseeds with sunflower seeds and soak them overnight in 1.5 cups of water. Flax seeds will soak most of the water. The mixture will look like a pudding.\r\n\r\n2. Put the mixture in the blender with the rest ingredients and blend everything to a dough. Set the dough in the fridge for half an hour.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-23-e1394978536941.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-138\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with g3 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-23-e1394978536941-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>3.

Then it's time to make them look like real taco shells. It's pretty easy. Just fold them in half and bake for another 15min or so until they become totally dry. \u00a0Remove the paper and enjoy them with your favorite taco fillings. I always go for salsa, guacamole and minced meat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNote: the baking time will depend on taco shells size, thickness and your oven. Check once in a while to see if they became dry and non-sticky. After folding them it takes only 10-15min to complete drying them.\r\n\r\nI made 9 pretty big taco shells.

I love salsa and guacamole! But let me tell you, it takes time to make mexican food if you want to do everything by yourself. Of course you can buy everything prepared and packaged: tortillas, taco shells, salsa, guacamole. But I believe that home cooked meal, made from scratch with no rush and lots of love will always taste better. Futhermore you can use whatever ingredients you want and avoid preservatives. In most of the cases it'll be much healthier. And we want to be healthy and happy, right?\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Recently I was experimenting with low carb and gluten free taco shells. Flax seed taco shells are our favorite at the moment - rich in fiber and taste great with salsa, minced meat and guacamole. And you need just a few ingredients.\u00a0It's not very easy to make them, but they are so worth it your time and frustration.

I love salsa and guacamole! But let me tell you, it takes time to make mexican food if you want to do everything by yourself. Of course you can buy everything prepared and packaged: tortillas, taco shells, salsa, guacamole. But I believe that home cooked meal, made from scratch with no rush and lots of love will always taste better. Futhermore you can use whatever ingredients you want and avoid preservatives. In most of the cases it'll be much healthier. And we want to be healthy and happy, right?\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Recently I was experimenting with low carb and gluten free taco shells. Flax seed taco shells are our favorite at the moment - rich in fiber and taste great with salsa, minced meat and guacamole. And you need just a few ingredients.\u00a0It's not very easy to make them, but they are so worth it your time and frustration. Let me share with you my tips for making taco shells from flax seeds.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-12.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-141 alignleft\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>You'll need:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1 cup flaxseeds\r\n1\/4 cup sunflower seeds\r\n1tsp cayenne pepper\r\n1\/4 red onion\r\n1 clove garlic\r\n1\/2 red pepper\r\nsalt and pepper to taste (about 1tsp each)\r\n\r\n<em>Directions:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1. Mix flaxseeds with sunflower seeds and soak them overnight in 1.5 cups of water. Flax seeds will soak most of the water. The mixture will look like a pudding.\r\n2. Put the mixture in the blender with the rest ingredients and blend everything to a dough. Set the dough in the fridge for half an hour.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-23-e1394978536941.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-138\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with g3 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-23-e1394978536941-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3. Now it's the most difficult part - to roll the dough and make taco shells. It'll be very sticky. I tried to roll it between two different baking papers. It works ok. Recently I took different approach. I cut the baking paper in the size of taco shells I wish to have, put some of the dough, cover it with plastic and flatten it with your fingers. This technique works best for me.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-32.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-139 alignleft\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-32-e1394979086502-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n4. Preheat the oven to 160 degress. Set the flat shells on the baking tray and bake them in the oven for about 40min. \u00a0Check when they become dry and not sticky anymore. Then it's time to make them look like real taco shells. It's pretty easy. Just fold them in half and bake for another 15min or so until they become totally dry. \u00a0Remove the paper and enjoy them with your favorite taco fillings. I always go for salsa, guacamole and minced meat. Yum!\r\n\r\nNote: the baking time will depend on taco shells size, thickness and your oven. Check once in a while to see if they became dry and non-sticky. After folding them it takes only 10-15min to complete drying them.\r\n\r\nI made 9 pretty big taco shells. I think you could make around 12 smaller ones.\r\n\r\nIt will be a sequel to this post with famous Allan's salsa recipe.\r\n\r\nBon app\u00e9tit!\r\n\r\nAsta",

Let me share with you my tips for making taco shells from flax seeds.<\/span>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Flaxseed Taco Shells<\/h5>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-12.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-141 alignleft\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>You'll need:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1 cup flaxseeds\r\n1\/4 cup sunflower seeds\r\n1tsp cayenne pepper\r\n1\/4 red onion\r\n1 clove garlic\r\n1\/2 red pepper\r\nsalt and pepper to taste (about 1tsp each)\r\n\r\n<em>Directions:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1. Mix flaxseeds with sunflower seeds and soak them overnight in 1.5 cups of water. Flax seeds will soak most of the water. The mixture will look like a pudding.\r\n\r\n2. Put the mixture in the blender with the rest ingredients and blend everything to a dough. Set the dough in the fridge for half an hour.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-23-e1394978536941.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-138\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with g3 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-23-e1394978536941-300x300.jpg\" width=\"270\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3. Now it's the most difficult part - to roll the dough and make taco shells. It'll be very sticky. I tried to roll it between two different baking papers. It works ok. Recently I took different approach. I cut the baking paper in the size of taco shells I wish to have, put some of the dough, cover it with plastic and flatten it with your fingers. This technique works best for me.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-32.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-139 alignleft\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-32-e1394979086502-225x300.jpg\" width=\"203\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a>\r\n4. Preheat the oven to 160 degress. Set the flat shells on the baking tray and bake them in the oven for about 40min. \u00a0Check when they become dry and not sticky anymore. Then it's time to make them look like real taco shells. It's pretty easy. Just fold them in half and bake for another 15min or so until they become totally dry. \u00a0Remove the paper and enjoy them with your favorite taco fillings. I always go for salsa, guacamole and minced meat. Yum!\r\n\r\nNote: the baking time will depend on taco shells size, thickness and your oven. Check once in a while to see if they became dry and non-sticky. After folding them it takes only 10-15min to complete drying them.\r\n\r\nI made 9 pretty big taco shells. I think you could make around 12 smaller ones.\r\n\r\nIt will be a sequel to this post with famous Allan's salsa recipe.\r\n\r\nBon app\u00e9tit!\r\n\r\nAsta",

I love salsa and guacamole! But let me tell you, it takes time to make mexican food if you want to do everything by yourself. Of course you can buy everything prepared and packaged: tortillas, taco shells, salsa, guacamole. But I believe that home cooked meal, made from scratch with no rush and lots of love will always taste better. Futhermore you can use whatever ingredients you want and avoid preservatives.

    "post_content": "I love having date nights with my love. Yummy food, a glass of red wine and a movie. Perfect! Last Saturday we had House of Cards marathon. I really like this tv show. Kevin Spacey is brilliant. I love his acting, especially his occasional remarks and glances straight to the camera. We never manage to watch only one episode, because the show gets you hooked and you want to know what happens next. If you haven't seen this show, give it a try! You can find it on Netflix.\r\n\r\nTacos were on the menu to go with the show. We usually make them once a month. I especially love homemade salsa and guacamole! But let me tell you, it takes time to make Mexican food if you want to do everything by yourself. Of course you can buy everything prepared and packaged: tortillas, taco shells, salsa, guacamole. But I believe that home cooked meal, made from scratch with no rush and lots of love will always taste better. Furthermore you can use whatever ingredients you want and avoid preservatives. In most of the cases it'll be much healthier. And we want to be healthy and happy, right?\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Recently I was experimenting with low carb and gluten free taco shells. Flax seed tacos are our favorite at the moment - rich in fiber and taste great with salsa, minced meat and guacamole. And you need just a few ingredients.\u00a0It's not very easy to make them, but they are so worth it your time and frustration. Let me share with you my tips for making taco shells from flax seeds.<\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Flaxseed Taco Shells<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-12.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-141 alignleft\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>You'll need:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1 cup flaxseeds\r\n1\/4 cup sunflower seeds\r\n1tsp cayenne pepper\r\n1\/4 red onion\r\n1 clove garlic\r\n1\/2 red pepper\r\nsalt and pepper to taste (about 1tsp each)\r\n\r\n<em>Directions:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1.

Let me share with you my tips for making taco shells from flax seeds.<\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Flaxseed Taco Shells<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-12.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-141 alignleft\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>You'll need:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1 cup flaxseeds\r\n1\/4 cup sunflower seeds\r\n1tsp cayenne pepper\r\n1\/4 red onion\r\n1 clove garlic\r\n1\/2 red pepper\r\nsalt and pepper to taste (about 1tsp each)\r\n\r\n<em>Directions:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1. Mix flaxseeds with sunflower seeds and soak them overnight in 1.5 cups of water. Flax seeds will soak most of the water. The mixture will look like a pudding.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-23-e1394978536941.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-138\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with g3 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-23-e1394978536941-300x300.jpg\" width=\"270\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n2. Put the mixture in the blender with the rest ingredients and blend everything to a dough. Set the dough in the fridge for half an hour\r\n\r\n3. Now it's the most difficult part - to roll the dough and make taco shells. It'll be very sticky. I tried to roll it between two different baking papers. It works ok. Recently I took different approach. I cut the baking paper in the size of taco shells I wish to have, put some of the dough, cover it with plastic and flatten it with my fingers. This technique works best for me.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-32.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-139 alignleft\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-32-e1394979086502-225x300.jpg\" width=\"203\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a>\r\n4. Preheat the oven to 160 degress. Set the flat shells on the baking tray and bake them in the oven for about 40min. They should become dry and not sticky anymore. Then it's time to make them look like real taco shells. It's pretty easy. Just fold them in half and bake for another 15min or so until they become totally dry. \u00a0Remove the paper and enjoy them with your favorite taco fillings. I always go for salsa, guacamole and minced meat. Yum!\r\n\r\n<em>Note:<\/em> the baking time will depend on taco shells size, thickness and your oven. Check once in a while to see if they became dry and non-sticky. After folding them it takes only 10-15min to complete drying them.\r\n\r\nI made 9 pretty big taco shells. I think you could make around 12 smaller ones.\r\n\r\nIt will be a sequel to this post with ridiculously spicy Allan's salsa recipe. In a few days!\r\n\r\nBon app\u00e9tit!\r\n\r\nAsta",

Hope everybody had a lovely weekend. I was working on Saturday. \u00a0In the evening I had a date night at home with my boyfriend. But Sunday was a special day to me. It was our 3 years anniversary. Woohoo! Three years of love and happiness! Who said love lasts only three years? I believe ours will last forever. Yep, I'm still inlove and see the world threw pink glasses.\r\n\r\nWe went to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smalhans.no\">Smalhans<\/a> for anniversary dinner. Great food, surprising wine list and nice personnel. Definitely going back there again! We took plenty of pictures. The place deserves a separate blog post.\r\n\r\nI love having date nights with my love. Yummy food, a glass of red wine and a movie. Perfect! Last Saturday we had House of Cards marathon. I really like this tv show. Kevin Spacey is brilliant. I love his acting, especially his occasional remarks and glances straight to the camera. We never manage to watch only one episode, because the show gets you hooked and you want to know what happens next. If you haven't seen this show, give it a try! You can find it on Netflix.\r\n\r\nTacos were on the menu to go with the show. We usually make them once a month. I especially love homemade salsa and guacamole! But let me tell you, it takes time to make Mexican food if you want to do everything by yourself. Of course you can buy everything prepared and packaged: tortillas, taco shells, salsa, guacamole. But I believe that home cooked meal, made from scratch with no rush and lots of love will always taste better. Furthermore you can use whatever ingredients you want and avoid preservatives. In most of the cases it'll be much healthier. And we want to be healthy and happy, right?\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Recently I was experimenting with low carb and gluten free taco shells. Flax seed tacos are our favorite at the moment - rich in fiber and taste great with salsa, minced meat and guacamole.

I like having people over for dinners, but had never ever invited anybody for breakfast or lunch. Last week we watched an episode of Cougar Town.

You'll need 8 eggs, 200g spinach, 8 sun-dried tomatoes, some butter, salt and pepper, and 8 ramekins. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees. Blanch the spinach, chop the sun-dried tomatoes and butter the ramekins. Now it's time to assemble. Divide the spinach between the ramekins, top it with sun-dried tomatoes, egg, salt and pepper. Put it in the oven for about 10-12 minutes and enjoy! I think it's very easy and super good idea for the brunch when you need to make more eggs at the time. Oven and ramekins saves you. It looks fancy and tastes great! We loved it.<\/p>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-copy-4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-181\" alt=\"photo copy 4\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-copy-4-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nFor the Green Detox drink you'll need:\r\n\r\nHalf \u00a0cucumber\r\nJuice of 1 lemon\r\n2 dates\r\nBunch of mint\r\nPiece of ginger root\r\n2 cups of water\r\n\r\nBlend everything and enjoy!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBaked carrot cake oatmeal recipe is on the Green Kitchen Stories App. If you don't have it yet, get it! So many yummy and healthy vegetarian recipes.\r\n\r\nMimosas doesn't need a special recipe. Just mix some bubbly with orange juice (half -half) and enjoy!\r\n\r\nI'm off to have Dosa now!

Blanch the spinach, chop the sun-dried tomatoes and butter the ramekins. Now it's time to assemble. Divide the spinach between the ramekins, top it with sun-dried tomatoes, egg, salt and pepper. Put it in the oven for about 10-12 minutes and enjoy! I think it's very easy and super good idea for the brunch when you need to make more eggs at the time. Oven and ramekins saves you. It looks fancy and tastes great! We loved it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;",

    "post_content": "Today I was thinking about my life in Norway, about friends, family and what does it mean to live in a foreign country. I moved to Norway more than four years ago. I believe that it was meant to be. My sister got a job offer in Oslo and I had an opportunity to come and finish my master studies at BI. It was easy to decide since my sister was going to move to the same city at the same time.\u00a0I really wanted to study abroad and the timing seamed perfect. In the last four years happened a lot. I graduated, found my love, made new friends and finally figured out what I want to do in my life. I'm not sure how my life would have been if I stayed in Lithuania. But I am happy now and that is all what matters to me.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/meandzuzu.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-187\" alt=\"meandzuzu\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/meandzuzu-300x200.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>Living abroad is not easy. The beginning was tough. Suddenly you are in the new place where you don't know anything, you don't know the culture, people, places, language. You have to invest your time and energy in learning, meeting new people and making new friends outside your comfort zone. The most difficult for me was to be far away from my very good friends, whom I new since my childhood. Suddenly I had to make new friends. I am always glad to meet new people from different cultures and countries. But I don't believe you can become friends over night. For me it takes time to open up and let people in to my heart. I believe in quality and not quantity of friends. Even if I miss me Lithuanian friends and think about them quite often, after four years in Norway I can say that I have met people here whom I call friends and believe that our connection will last forever. I feel like I belong here and I call Oslo my home now.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about living in an international city as Oslo, is that you get to meet people from all over the world, you get to know their culture, traditions and food! It's not a surprise, I love food! And I would like to share with you some of the recipes I got from my friends.\r\n\r\nLet's start with my friend Allan. He is a very nice guy from Texas, whom I was lucky to meet in Oslo. It was sad that he had to move back to the states, but I believe that I'll see him again. He shared with me his salsa recipe. I've been using it for the last half a year. Trust me, it's really good. Texicans know their tex-mex food. I haven't made any other salsa since. It's definitely a winner at our home. Though it is crazy spicy! If you are up for the challenge, here is the recipe:\r\n\r\nAllan's salsa\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

My sister got a job offer in Oslo and I had an opportunity to come and finish my master studies at BI. It was easy to decide since my sister was going to move to the same city at the same time.\u00a0I really wanted to study abroad and the timing seemed perfect. I think it was meant to be. In the last four years many things happened in my life. I graduated, found my love, made new friends and finally figured out what I want to do in my life. I'm not sure how my life would have been if I stayed in Lithuania.

The beginning was tough. Suddenly I was in a new place where I didn't know anything, I didn't know culture, people, places, language.

It was really difficult to be far away from my very good friends, whom I knew since my childhood. I missed them a lot and still do.\r\n\r\nI was always glad to meet new people with different backgrounds and experiences. But I don't believe you can become friends over night. For me it takes time to open up and let people in to my heart. I believe in quality and not quantity of friends. Even if I miss my Lithuanian friends and think about them quite often, after four years in Norway I can say that I have met people here whom I call friends now and believe that our connection will last forever. I feel like I belong here. Home is where my heart is. And it is in Oslo now.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about living in international Oslo, is that you get to meet people from all over the world, you get to know their culture, traditions and food!

With spring, life, love, food, music... Mayer Hawthorne iTunes radio channel is playing. Love his kind of music. Happy tunes, happy me. Didn't have to work today. \u00a0Yuppy! Love days for myself. In the morning had a session at the gym with a personal trainer. We worked on my upper body. OMG, my arms and back were shaking. He really pushed me hard. I am sure, I won't be able to lift anything tomorrow. But hopefully soon the hard work will pay off with bikini season body.\n\nAfter the hard workout, I treated myself with acai-blueberry smoothie. Blended together some frozen blueberries, acai powder, avocado, coconut water, oats and chia seeds. Topped with dried mulberries, coconut and cacao nibs. Voila! Really refreshing and rebooting. Love smoothies on the sunny days like today.\n\nNow it's time for Banana bread! For the third time this week. I am really \u00a0obsessed with it. Maybe because we had so many eggs and bananas at home. I decided to make something from them. So, I baked banana bread and me and boyfriend loved it! First try was with pomegranate seeds and pistachios. Really good. Second time I used cranberries. It was good, but not great. My last choice was pomegranate and walnuts. Perfection! I am sure you can make with something else and it'll be great. Just choose whatever you like. I love pomegranate. My tip to open it quickly. Cut pomegranate in half. Put it in the bowl of cold water. Wait ten minutes. It'll be pretty easy to remove the seeds after that. Trust me. Here goes my banana bread recipe:\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Banana Bread Love<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">(gluten, dairy &amp; sugar free)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/p>\n<em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-221\" alt=\"photo 2\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>You'll need:<\/em>\n4 ripe bananas\n4 eggs\n8 pitted dates\n1\/4 cup coconut oil\n1\/2 coconut flour\n1Tbsp baking powder\n1tsp cinnamon\n1\/2tsp nutmeg\nseeds from 1 pomegranate\nhandful of walnuts\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-33.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-222\" alt=\"photo 3\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-33-e1396014305977-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>Directions:<\/em>\n1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees. Grease the bread baking tray with some coconut oil, half teaspoon.\n2. Blend bananas, egg, coconut oil and dates.\n3. Add coconut flour, cinnamon, baking powder and nutmeg. Mix in everything by hand just to combine.\n4. Add walnuts and pomegranate seeds. Mix them in.\n5. Pour in the bread baking tray. Put in the oven and bake for about 45min. Start checking after half an hour. The toothpick inserted in the bread should come out clean.\nVoila! Tastes great on its own or with some peanut butter or ice cream on top. Yum!\n\nI am off to IKEA now. Thinking about redecorating our kitchen. Since I spend so much time in it. Will see what IKEA has to offer.\n\nHave a wonderful weekend everybody!\n\nAsta &lt;3",

With spring, life, love, food, music... Mayer Hawthorne iTunes radio channel is playing. Love his kind of music. Happy tunes, happy me. Didn't have to work today. \u00a0Yuppy! Love days for myself. In the morning had a session at the gym with a personal trainer. We worked on my upper body. OMG, my arms and back were shaking. He really pushed me hard. I am sure, I won't be able to lift anything tomorrow. But hopefully soon the hard work will pay off with bikini season body.\r\n\r\nAfter the hard workout, I treated myself with acai-blueberry smoothie. Blended together some frozen blueberries, acai powder, avocado, coconut water, oats and chia seeds. Topped with dried mulberries, coconut and cacao nibs. Voila! Really refreshing and rebooting. Love smoothies on the sunny days like today.\r\n\r\nNow it's time for Banana bread! For the third time this week. I am really \u00a0obsessed with it. Maybe because we had so many eggs and bananas at home. I decided to make something from it. Baked banana bread and we loved it! First try was with pomegranate seeds and pistachios. Really good. Second time I used cranberries. It was good, but not great. My last option was pomegranate and walnuts. Perfection! I am sure you can make with something else and it'll be perfect. Just choose whatever you like. I love pomegranate. My tip to open it quickly. Cut pomegranate in half. Put it in the bowl of cold water. Wait ten minutes. It'll be pretty easy to remove the seeds after that. Trust me.

I spend my afternoon reading one of my all time favorite books: The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. I read this book every few years. It helps me to hold onto a sense of innocence and imagination, and not to lose myself while growing up. My favorite paragraph of the the book is this:\n<blockquote>\u201cGoodbye,\u201d said the fox. \u201cHere is my secret. It\u2019s quite simple: One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes. . . . It\u2019s the time that you spent on your rose that makes your rose so important. . . . People have forgotten this truth,\u201d the fox said, \u201cBut you mustn\u2019t forget it. You become responsible for what you\u2019ve tamed. You\u2019re responsible for your rose. . . .\u201d<\/blockquote>\nSo much wisdom in this book. We should all live by these standards. If we tell someone we love them, we must mean it. If we make a friend, \u00a0we have to be mindful of the kind of friend we are. Be kind. Be responsible. Oh, I highly recommend this book to everyone! It is a very easy and inspiring read. Why not read it on your Easter Holidays? I think it's a perfect holiday treat for yourself.\n\nHere in Norway, people read crime books and watch crime movies during Easter. It is still a mystery to me, which nobody could explain me yet. How Easter and crime are related? Well, maybe some day I'll understand it, but until then Easter for me is about dying eggs. I never really cared to much about Easter. It was never very celebrated in my family. All the celebrations and attention goes to Christmas Holidays and Easter gets kind of forgotten. But... We always do one thing during Easter. We dye eggs! And we eat them afterwards. That's all what Easter is about. At least for me. I would like to share the way we do it in my family. \u00a0It's super simple and easy and you can get yourself some nice eggs for Easter table decorations and of course consumption.\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"noBorder\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-266\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with m3 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><em>You'll need<\/em>:\n\nEggs\n\nDry onion outer skins\n\nOld nylon stockings (washed)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The way to do it is very simple.

If you haven't seen it yet, I highly\u00a0<\/span>recommend<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">! \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nThis movie reminded me of another excellent movies \u00a0by Wes Anderson - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1748122\/?ref_=tt_rec_tt\">Moonrise Kingdom<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0432283\/\">Fantastic Mr. Fox<\/a>. They are\u00a0as well quirky, sweet, beautiful and funny. I want to watch them again!\r\n\r\nI think it's a good trio for a movie night with your friends. Charming, colorful movies which make you laugh and feel happy!\r\n\r\nIf you're planning a movie night, you'll need some food, right? I suggest having tacos, because I like Mexican food. \u00a0I already posted my flax seed tacos and salsa recipes. And here goes my holy guacamole recipe. Simple, easy and super delicious! If you don't have time to make tacos, you can always use salsa and guacamole as yummy dips for chips or veggies for your movie night!\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Holy Guacamoly<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-3-copy.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-206\" alt=\"photo 3 copy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo-3-copy-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><em><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>You'll need:<\/em><\/p>\r\n4 ripe avocados\r\nHalf of red onion\r\n1 lime\r\nHandful of cherry tomatoes\r\nBunch of fresh coriander\r\n1 tsp of each: salt, cumin and cayenne pepper\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Directions:\u00a0<\/em>\r\n\r\n1.

Adjust salt, pepper and lime.\r\nVoila!\u00a0Enjoy on the toast, with your tacos or as a dip.\r\n\r\nSorry, no picture of the guacamole this time. The quality was not so good. But trust me, the taste is great! Will add the picture later, the next time I make it again. It'll be soon. I love guacamole.\r\n\r\nHave a wonderful the rest of the week \u00a0my lovelies!

Here comes the recipe:\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Hemp protein energy nut bars<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"noBorder\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-234\" alt=\"photo 1 copy 3\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-1-copy-3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"325\" \/>\n1 cup almond meal\nHalf cup oats\n1\/4 cup hemp protein powder\n1\/4 cup melted coconut oil\n4 Tbsp date syrup\n1Tbsp chia seeds\n1 Tbsp grounded flax seeds\n1\/2 cup walnuts (chopped)\nHandful of goji berries\nHandful of dried cranberries\n\nNot in the picture: 200g of dark chocolate (at least 70% cacao).\nShredded coconut chips (for decoration, optional)<\/p>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<em>Directions:<\/em>\n1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees.\n2. Mix all ingredients until everything combines and gets wet. It should look like a wet crumble.\n3. Place everything in the baking form. I used 25cm round silicon baking form. If you are using not silicon baking form, firstly rub some coconut oil on the pan or use baking paper. Press everything well to the bottom of the pan.\n4. Bake for about 25min until the \"cake\" dries and the surface becomes brown.\n5. Let it cool down for 20minutes. Meanwhile melt 100g of the chocolate.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-copy-5.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-253\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with g3 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-copy-5-e1396890948986-225x300.jpg\" width=\"325\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a>\n6. Pour the chocolate on the cooled nut bars cake and spread it using spatula. Set in the fridge for 15min. Meanwhile melt the rest of the chocolate (100g).\n7. Take out the cake from the fridge. Put a baking paper on top of the cake and flip it over. Pour the rest of the melted chocolate on the \"bottom\" of the cake. Sprinkle with coconut. Set back to the fridge for a half an hour.\n8. Take out the cake from the fridge and cut in desirable pieces. I made 16 small energy bars.\nEnjoy!",

I spend my afternoon reading one of my all time favorite books: The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. I read this book every few years. It helps me to hold onto a sense of innocence and imagination, and not to lose myself while growing up. My favorite paragraph of the the book is this:\n<blockquote>\u201cGoodbye,\u201d said the fox. \u201cHere is my secret. It\u2019s quite simple: One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes. . . . It\u2019s the time that you spent on your rose that makes your rose so important. . . . People have forgotten this truth,\u201d the fox said, \u201cBut you mustn\u2019t forget it. You become responsible for what you\u2019ve tamed. You\u2019re responsible for your rose. . . .\u201d<\/blockquote>\nSo much wisdom in this book. We should all live by these standards. If we tell someone we love them, we must mean it. If we make a friend, \u00a0we have to be mindful of the kind of friend we are. Be kind. Be responsible. Oh, I highly recommend this book to everyone! It is a very easy and inspiring read. Why not read it on your Easter Holidays? I think it's a perfect holiday treat for yourself.\n\nHere in Norway, people read crime books and watch crime movies during Easter. It is still a mystery to me, which nobody could explain me yet. How Easter and crime are related? Well, maybe some day I'll understand it, but until then Easter for me is about dying eggs. I never really cared to much about Easter. It was never very celebrated in my family. All the celebrations and attention goes to Christmas Holidays and Easter gets kind of forgotten. But... We always do one thing during Easter. We dye eggs! And we eat them afterwards. That's all what Easter is about. At least for me. I would like to share the way we do it in my family. \u00a0It's super simple and easy and you can get yourself some nice eggs for Easter table decorations and of course consumption.\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"noBorder\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-266\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with m3 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><em>You'll need<\/em>:Eggs\n\nDry onion outer skins\n\nOld nylon stockings (washed)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The way to do it is very simple.

I think I was spending too much time on Instagram. Looking through all these beautiful, yummy food pictures is not only inspiring, but it is time consuming as well. Therefore the last few weeks were less internet and more quality time with my love.Now I am back online again with full speed and new ideas!\r\n\r\nI spend my Easter holidays in Tuscany! This place is amazing: super cute little hill towns, yummy foods, delicious wines. What else can one wish for, right? I really want to go back there. Some day I will. Now I am looking forward for my summer vacation in Sicily! Time to start planning. Any advices, restaurant suggestions?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-11.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-283\" alt=\"photo 1\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-11-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>The last week has been amazing in Oslo, sunny and warm. We started to spend our afternoons on the balcony. I love having a balcony. If it is sunny outside, you can always find us there. Reading, studying, chilling, having dinner or a glass of wine, or everything at the same time. \r\n\r\nDid I tell you, that I love grilling? If not, please do know, that soon many grilling recipes will be coming your way. We got a gass grill last year for the balcony and we use it a lot! This year we opened the grilling season just a few days ago. And I already have my new favorite dish! Grilled sweet potato with pickled onion, lime juice and fresh coriander. Just writing about it makes me hungry. Trust me, it's super delicious! Give it a try. It can be a great appetizer or a side dish for your summer party. Here goes very simple recipe:\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"noBorder\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-284\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-21-e1398707369611-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><em>You'll need:<\/em>\r\nSweet potatotoes\r\n1\/4 cup of Olive oil\r\nSalt, pepper\r\n2 Limes\r\nBunch of Fresh Coriander\r\nPickled red onions(made in adcance)<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<em>Directions:<\/em>\r\nPeel the sweet potatoes and slice them 1cm wide. I used three big ones, it was enough for 3 persons to snack on as an appetizer.\r\nCoat them with salt, pepper and 2 Tbsp of olive oil.\r\nHeat your grill on medium and put the potatoes on. I grilled them about 6min on each side.\r\nWhile they are grilling quickly make the dressing. Mix the rest of the olive oil with the juices of two limes. Chop the fresh coriander. Get your pickled onions.\r\nWhen the sweet potatoes are done and have grill lines, remove them from the fire and coat with olive oil\/lime mixture. Then take one by one, put a few onion rings on top, sprinkle with fresh coriander and enjoy!\r\n\r\nPlease let me know, if you would like me to share my pickled onions recipe. It's pretty basic, just red onions, vinegar, water, salt and some palm sugar.\r\n\r\nHave a lovely week everybody!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nAsta",

    "post_content": "It's been so long since my last post. Two weeks!!! I know it's not the right way to do it, since I just started blogging. The truth is I needed some web\/online detox. I think I was spending too much time on Instagram. Looking through all these beautiful, yummy food pictures is not only inspiring, but it is time consuming as well. Therefore the last few weeks were less internet and more quality time with my love.Now I am back online again with full speed and new ideas!\r\n\r\nI spend my Easter holidays in Tuscany! This place is amazing: super cute little hill towns, yummy foods, delicious wines. What else can one wish for, right? I really want to go back there. Some day I will. Now I am looking forward for my summer vacation in Sicily! Time to start planning. Any advices, restaurant suggestions?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-11.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-283\" alt=\"photo 1\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/photo-11-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>The last week has been amazing in Oslo, sunny and warm. We started to spend our afternoons on the balcony. I love having a balcony. If it is sunny outside, you can always find us there. Reading, studying, chilling, having dinner or a glass of wine, or everything at the same time. \r\n\r\nDid I tell you, that I love grilling? If not, please do know, that soon many grilling recipes will be coming your way. We got a gass grill last year for the balcony and we use it a lot! This year we opened the grilling season just a few days ago. And I already have my new favorite dish! Grilled sweet potato with pickled onion, lime juice and fresh coriander. Just writing about it makes me hungry. Trust me, it's super delicious! Give it a try. It can be a great appetizer or a side dish for your summer party.

What else can one ask for, right?\r\n\r\nNext on my \"Me Day\" is to make some yummy goodies in the kitchen, because it is my favorite place in our apartment. Kitchen experiments are the best therapy for me. Cooking cheers me up, lifts me up, relaxes and calms me. Have no idea what I am going to make yet. Need to check my cabinets for some ingredients. I feel like making something sweet... Will let you know on my next post \u00a0how it turned out.\r\n\r\nBefore I go back to Me Time, I would like to share my last kitchen experiments.

Everybody has to have some \"Me\" time once in a while. Today is My day. I have a day off, my Love is at work, so I can do whatever I want. I know that I HAVE so many things on my chores list. BUT everything can wait. Today is about ME and what I WANT to do. I had a perfect lazy morning with a few cups of coffee, oatmeal and silly girly tv shows. It is so good sometimes to do nothing, right? I had so much time to think and reflect on my life. I have a job which I like and which helps me build my future in the direction where I see myself going. I know quite a few inspiring people who help me grow as well. And I have a best boyfriend ever who supports me in everything I do. Days like this make me realize how blessed I am. I am Healthy, Happy and Loved! And I still have inner \u00a0innocent child inside me who sees only the best in people and sometimes likes to play. What else can one ask for, right?\r\n\r\nNext on my \"Me Day\" is to make some yummy goodies in the kitchen, because it is my favorite place in our apartment. Kitchen experiments are the best therapy for me. Have no idea what I am going to make yet. Need to check my cabinets for some ingredients. I feel like making something sweet... Will let you know on my next post \u00a0how it turned out.\r\n\r\nBefore I go back to Me Time, I would like to share my last kitchen experiments. I made some yummy sweet treats from leftover almond meal. They turned out pretty good. Though I feel that there is room for improvement, so the next time I have some almond meal, I'll try to do them again. Until then, here goes my Drunk Marzipan Chocolates.\r\n\r\n<em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/photo-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-290\" alt=\"Processed with VSCOcam with f2 preset\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/photo-1-e1399466514288-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>You'll need:<\/em>\r\n1.5 cups almond meal (leftovers from makinf almond meal)\r\n2Tbsp coconut sugar\r\n1 shot glass of Cointreeau\r\n25g of cacao butter\r\n100g of very dark chocolate + 1Tbsp coconut oil (optional)\r\na handful of walnuts (optional)\r\n\r\n<em>Directions:<\/em>\r\n1.

I had a pretty good week since my last post. Last weekend there was a relay race (Holmenkollen stafetten) and I participated in it. My boyfriend's company lacked a few people. So I stepped in. For a free t-shirt and dinner afterwards. \u00a0Jokes aside, I was really happy that they offered to me. I love such events. It feels like all the people of Oslo are outside. Everybody are either running or cheering. Love happy vibes in the air.\r\n\r\nMy part was 370m, but I gave all myself in and ran like somebody was trying to catch me. I don't think I ever ran as fast. I was pooped afterwards. But happy! 370m in 71s. Pretty proud of myself ! Afterwards we went for some Indian food to Gandhi. It was amazing! I can never get enough of Indian food.\r\n\r\nRecently I starting making granola and I am loving it! You can get really creative and mix whatever ingredients you have at the moment. Usually it turns out great. Let me share with you my basic granola recipe. It was the first one I made and it tasted absolutely divine. And the smell of roasted nuts... I am inlove!\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Basic Granola<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/photo-11.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-301\" alt=\"photo 1\" src=\"http:\/\/www.incurablyhappy.com\/chef\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/photo-11-e1400092364417-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><em>You'll need:<\/em>\r\n\r\n1 cup oats\r\n2Tbsp coconut oil\r\n3tsp date syrup or honey\r\n1tsp cinnamon\r\n1\/4 cup each: walnuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, flaxseeds, dried mulberries, coconut flakes, goji berries\r\nA few drops of vanilla essence\r\n\r\nDirections:\r\n\r\n1.
